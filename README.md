# Description : 
```The Contact Management App is a Flutter-based application designed to store and manage contacts locally using SQLite while also providing a backup to Firebase Firestore. It allows users to add, update, and delete contacts with fields such as name, phone number, and email, and includes a Firebase Authentication feature for secure login. The app supports offline access, syncing data with Firestore when back online, and enables contact search by name. The UI is simple, using a ListView to display contacts and a Floating Action Button (FAB) for adding new entries. Submission includes code and a demo video showing app functionality.```
